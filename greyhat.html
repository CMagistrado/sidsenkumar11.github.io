          Today, we'll work through some web challenges on a wargame.<br /><br />
          Wargames are like CTFs in that you need to find a flag, but the problems stay
          up forever and there is no prize if you win. The reason why wargames are good is
          that you can practice doing problems at any time, going at your own pace and learning

          When we make request to a website, a bunch of metadata gets sent to the website that identifies us.<br /><br />
          This information is known as HTTP headers. Your browser automatically sends it to the server whenever you request a webpage
          so that the server knows who you are. As a practical application of this, this is how servers know whether to send you a mobile
          version of their site or a desktop version - they will read a particular header that tells them what kind of device you are browsing from.<br /><br />
          <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa287673(v=vs.71).aspx">This</a> website has some more information if you're interested.<br /><br />
          Checking headers for security purposes, like seeing if you are an authorized user, or to see if you are accessing a website from a particular place, is not a good idea.
          This is because request headers can easily be modified by the user before being sent to the the server.

          Just like we don't trust the request's header files, we also never trust any user side cookies.<br /><br />

          Sometimes, we have PHP scripts in the backend that serve up the information/files that a user requests on a website.
          The script will do exactly what the user asks it to do. Normally, a user will just click a link that will send a particular
          request to the PHP script. However, we can modify the input so that we can get to files we were not meant to see.

          Today, we're going to do some RSA cryptography.
          RSA is an asymmetric encryption algorithm developed by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman (hence RSA).<br /><br />
          The principle of assymetric encryption is as follows:<br /><br />
          1) A "lock" is made. We throw this lock into the wild and keep the key to ourselves.<br /><br />
          2) Anyone who wants to send us a secret message picks up our lock and "locks" their information with it before sending it to us.<br /><br />
          3) Now, since we are the only person with the key to the lock, we are the only one able to decrypt the message.<br /><br />

        With assymetric cryptosystems, we call the "lock" a <u>public key</u>, and the "key to the lock" a <u>private key</u>. Everyone has access to the public key,
        but only we have access to the private key.<br />

            RSA depends on the fact that factoring is difficult. If an algorithm is created to factor numbers rapidly and easily,
            then RSA breaks down. This in turn means that to make proper and secure implementations of RSA, you need to choose proper moduli
            that are large enough to be difficult to factor.

          This week, we'll be learning about SQL injection.
          Ever wonder how exactly attackers go about stealing people's usernames, passwords, and data from websites? You hear about companies getting hacked all the time, but how does that happen? Well more often than not, this happens due to a type of attack called SQL injection.
          <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
          As a quick recap - with any website, we have a front end and a back end. The front end takes care of what you actually see - the colors, the styling, the placement of the words on your screen, etc. This involves languages/tools like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and other front end web-development frameworks. You can see all the front-end code
          since the front end code is what is sent to your browser to render the page.

        <p class="lead">
        <br /><br />
        On the other hand, many websites have a back end. The back end includes server side languages and scripting languages that actually serve up information for you from a database. The language that a lot of databases use is SQL. SQL is a database query language that, upon request, can read or write to a database.
        <a href="http://www.sqlcourse.com/table.html">Here</a> is a nice website to learn some of the basics of SQL if you are unfamiliar.
        <br /><br />
        We can use badly coded queries to serve up information to the user that the user of a site might not have been intended to receive by providing special input strings that trick the database. We call this "SQL injection".

          Sometimes, a file is not exactly what it seems! In this problem, I will introduce the concept of File Signatures. A file signature is a sequence of bytes at the beginning of a file that denote what kind of file it is.
          <br /><br />
          Often, we may modify the file's existing binary data to secretly embed other files within it.

        Hint 1: Look for suspicious things in the binary data of the file. To do this, a hex editor will be helpful. I prefer to use <a href="http://download.cnet.com/HxD-Hex-Editor/3000-2352_4-10891068.html">HxD</a>, but there are lots of good editors out there that you can find with a quick Google search.

        Hint 2: (This will make sense once you get to this part of the problem): What kind of encoding usually ends with "=="?

            This week's problem set will be about breaking password hashes.
            <br /><br />
            At GreyHat on Thursday, we went over Wi-Fi attacks using programs such as Aerodump and Aircrack. What these programs do
            is collect many hashed and encrypted packets over the network and attempt to brute force the password that leads to the right hash.

            Using a bad hashing algorithm results in hashes that can easily be reverse engineered.
            <br /><br />
            This means you could figure out the plaintext password!

              Oh no! You're at the last day at the end of the semester at Tech but you find out that you're failing CS 1332! Not wanting your future employer to find this out, you decide
              you must take drastic measures to fix your grade.
              <br /><br />
              Fortunately, Tech is still using 1960s version of GTWifi and security protocols so you're able to intercept your professor's hashed password on the network.
              <br /><br />
              You also happen to have a contact in the IT department. He's a balding, single, middle aged man named Joe. Fed up with his work, his boss, and the fact that his department possibly has the worst security protocols in the country, he decides he is willing to provide you with a copy of the hashing algorithm.
              <br /><br />
              Can you reverse engineer the hash and find out the password in time to change your grade?

              Hint 1:
              The plaintext is a sentence, and the actual flag is somewhere in the sentence. The flag is in the form easyctf{...}<br />
              There will be some guesswork involved to find out what the ... and the rest of the sentence is.

            One day, you're about to go out on a date with a cute girl but you secretly think she might be crazy. In an effort to find out, you decide to hack into her email account.

            Cryptography is the art of code making and cryptanalysis is the art of code breaking.

            There is another encryption scheme called the "One Time Pad". This is quite famous because it is known to be one of the only "perfect" encryptions - that is, when implemented correctly, it has been
            mathematically proven to be impossible to break.
            <br /><br />
            The way the one time pad works is as follows:<br /><br />
            1) Generate a random key at least as long as the plaintext.<br />
            2) XOR the plaintext with the key.<br /><br />
            It is definitely a very simple algorithm, and can lead to very secure encryption, but when not implemented correctly can lead to vulnerability.
