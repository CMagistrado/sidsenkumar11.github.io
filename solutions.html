            <font color="orange">
              1. A google search of A000045 brings us to this website: <a href="https://oeis.org/A000045">https://oeis.org/A000045</a>. We realize that A000045 is actually a sequence of integers, namely a variant of the Fibonnaci sequence.
              <br /><br />
              2. Now we can take a look at the text file. An obvious guess to find the flag would be to Ctrl+F the word "flag", but we can see that this brings nearly 70 matches. The file appears to be a randomly generated sequence of characters, so it is likely
              that these occurrences of "flag" are completely arbitrary - it just so happened the there were four random characters generated such that 'F' happened to be next to 'L' which happened to be next to 'A' and so on.
              <br /><br />
              3. Instead, let us try using the sequence as indices into the large text file. For example, since the sequence starts with 0, 1, 1..., take the 0th character in the file, the 1st characterin the file, the 1st character in the file, and so on and concatenate them together.
              <br /><a href="resources/A000045.py">Here is a script that will do this.</a>
              Running the script in the same directory as the A000045.txt file produces the output "pffibonacciiscoolandtheflagisrecursion".

            Some background knowledge:<br />
            The first few bytes of every file's binary data are denoted the "File Signature". The File Signature tells the computer what kind of file it is dealing with. For example, for a JPG file, the file signature is "FF D8 FF DB".<br />
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <font color="orange">
              1. Save the image of deadpool's body onto your Desktop. Open it up with a hex editor and notice that the first few bytes are indeed FF D8 FF D8! It is a JPG file.
              <br /><br />
              2. Now a good idea would be to CTRL+F the word "flag" or anything else that might be suspicious in the data. We see the phrase "WANTAFLAG?LOOKNOFURTHER!" near the end of the file.
              <br /><br />
              3. Immediately after this text, we see more more hex data. If you google "PK File signature", you will find that PK file signatures denote .zip files. So, we actually have an archive appended to the end of our image!

              <img src="resources/stego1.PNG" />
              4. Copy and paste the binary data for the archive file into a new tab in the hex editor. Save the file and give it any name you like but save it as a .zip file.
              <br /><br />
              5. Extract the zip file and what do we find? A suspicious file named "wow.txt"!
              <img src="resources/stego1hidden.PNG" />
              6. Open the text file and we see the text in the image above. Notice that the text ends in "==". This is highly likely to be base 64 encoded to text. So simply copy the text and use your favorite "base 64 to ASCII" website and decipher the text to be:
              <br />

            You're told that the flag is on the current page, so there are only so many places that the flag could be. The title of this problem is "Any Questions or Comments?", so let's try looking at the HTML source of this page and looking for any comments that might contain the flag.
            <br /><br />
            Visting "view-source:sidsenkumar11.github.io/greyhat.html" displays the source HTML for the curren page. Then simply Ctrl+F the word "flag" until you find it at the bottom of the page.

            Note: You could brute force the URL for this problem or go to my Github commit history to find the solution, but as the intention was to get you familiar with Burp Suite, this is not the recommended solution.
            <br />
            <br />
            First, as the hint suggests, we are going to download Burp Suite. Burp Suite is a jar file that should be in the toolkit of any network CTF problem solver. What is Burp Suite? It is a program that analyzes all network traffic coming into and out of your browser. This is very useful for finding things that may not directly be visible on the actual rendered page.
            You can find the link <a href="https://portswigger.net/burp/download.html">here</a>.
            <br /><br />
            Next, we need to configure our browser to send network traffic through Burp Suite. This is easily done on browsers like Firefox by opening the Advanced tab and changing the proxy settings. You can find a tutorial on how to do this <a href="https://portswigger.net/burp/tutorials/ConfiguringYourBrowser.html">here</a>.

            <br /><br />
            Finally, open up Burp Suite (can be run using java -jar) and open up the browser with the configured proxy settings. Note that the problem hint says "Spider". This is a function in Burp Suite that essentially crawls the pages you visit on the browser and makes a map of all links, images, and pages it finds. Go to the "Spider" tab in Burp Suite and click "Spider is paused" so that Spider will be enabled. Now, let's visit the url in question (i.e. sidsenkumar11.github.io).
            <br /><br />
            Browse around the website and click on as many links and pages as possible. (If the browser seems to be stuck on "Connecting", see Note 2 below). If you click on some of the project links, like "Password Manager", you will reach in-progress.html. If you've done this, go back to Burp Suite.
            <br /><br />
            On the left pane of Burp Suite, expand the arrow next to sidsenkumar11.github.io to see what Spider has collected information on.
            <img src="resources/BurpsuiteExpanded.PNG" />
            <br />
            Notice how there is a page it found called "theflag.html"? This seems suspicious! Let's visit sidsenkumar11.github.io/theflag.html
            <img src="resources/theflagpage.PNG" />
            <br />
            Aha! The page renders and there is text on it! The word "INTERMEDIATE" should tell you that we are close to the flag since this is the Intermediate problem. Now looking at the text to the right, we can see spaces, underscores, and curly braces but the text does not make any sense. Likely the text was encrypted with a simple substitution cipher.
            <br />
            Putting the text into <a href="http://www.richkni.co.uk/php/crypta/caesar.php">this website</a> and viewing all the shifts reveals one shift that produces readable text, which is the flag.
            <br /><br />
            Flag: GREYHAT_ GATECH{HIDDEN_WEBSITE_FAIL}
            <br /><br />
            Note 2: If the browser is stuck on "Connecting", you are likely stuck on Intercept. Go to the Proxy tab in Burp Suite and go to the Intercept sub-tab. Click "Intercept is on" to turn Intercept off.

          <p class="lead">

            Take a look at the hashing algorithm to see what is happening to see if we can reverse engineer a ciphertext.<br />
            For every character in the plaintext:<br />
            <blockquote>
              <font color="orange">
            1) ord(c) gets the ASCII value of the character. Ex. 'A' becomes 65.<br /><br />
            2) This number has an operation done to it; namely //key. We know key to be 3. A google search reveals that the "//" operation in python is floor division (integer division).
            For example, this means that 81//3 = 82//3 = 83//3 = 27.<br /><br />
            Let's now look at the first number in the ciphertext: <font color="red">27</font>.
            <br />27 is the quotient after the ascii value of the first letter in the plaintext was floor divided by 3. What are the possible numbers that can result in 27?<br />
            <br />Well, as I showed in 2), all three of 81, 82, and 83 yield 27 when we floor divide by 3!
            <br />So, for 27, we know that the plaintext ascii value is either 81, 82, or 83. These correspond to the ASCII characters <font color="red">'Q', 'R', and 'S'</font> (you can use an ASCII table to verify this).
            <br /><br />
            3) Repeat the process shown above for every character to generate a table of all possible values for each number given in the ciphertext. <a href="resources/FloorDivideSolution.py">Here's a script I wrote.</a>
            <br />

              <font color="orange">
                1) The SHA-256 is a fairly secure hash so the only we're going to be able to reverse this is by a bruteforce dictionary attack. Since we know the format of the password, let's create a few dictionaries and save them as text files.<br />
                <a href="resources/SomeDictionaries.zip">Here's some I made.</a><br /><br />
                2) We're basically going to append every combination of words from the dictionaries, hash them, and see if the hash matches. Ex. Try toyota111. , then try toyota111!, then try toyota111?, .... honda111. , honda111! and so on.<br /><br />
                If a hash matches the one given, we found our password. Note that there is no need for you to learn exactly how the SHA-256 hashes the words; people have already written many hash functions for you to use.<br /><br />

              <p class="lead">
              A few friendly notes:<br />
              1) Remember to try every combination of capital and lowercase letters in the car word. So the password could have had "TOyota" or "tOYotA" or any combination of capitals and lowercase letters.<br />
              2) A few people had the right script to come up with permuations of words but could not find the correct password. Remember to add as many words as possible to your dictionary! In my dictionary I did not put that many but you should.<br />
              3) Of course, the more words you have in your dictionaries, the longer the script will take to run. For me, the script took ~30 seconds with an i7 processor.<br />
